## ⚠️ Important Warnings & Disclaimer

### Fresh Install Requirement

**This configuration is tailored for a FRESH INSTALL of VANILLA ARCH LINUX using the archinall script with the Hyprland profile.** We strongly advise against attempting this installation on derivative distributions (such as CachyOS, Manjaro, etc.) as package and configuration conflicts are highly likely. This includes packages you could install yourself, through Arch's repo, and a few AUR packages. This will install the chaotic AUR, the only AUR exclusive package that is installed, is the Noctalia bar itself. 

### Development Status

This script, is now released. It is no longer in beta state. This project originally started as a vibe coded project to see what we could get away with. It quickly turned into only being an outline, as A.I is too frustrating to deal with after more than 80 lines of code. The rest, is completely scripted by tonekneeo, and myself.

### Nvidia Users

Once in the system open ~/.config/hyprland/startup.conf and uncomment the Nvidia section then reboot.

### Credits

The primary application bar (`noctalia-shell-git`) is based on the exceptional work by **Noctalia**. All credit for the bar's design and functionality goes to them:

## ⚙️ Customization Required

These dotfiles are provided strictly as a **template**. You **must** review and customize several files to align with your specific hardware, desired aesthetics, and system paths.

| File/Section | Customization Needed | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`hypr/hyprland.conf`** | Monitor setup (resolution, scaling, refresh rate). | The current default is `monitor=,preferred,auto,1`. You may use `nwg-displays` to help configure and export precise settings. |

Open your terminal and clone the repository using `git`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Echilonvibin/minimaLinux.git
```

### Step 2: Change directory to the repo
